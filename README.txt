Camelcase:


Time complexity = O(n), since the method has 1 for loop based on the input array of size n.

Space complexity = O(n), since the method uses an array of size n





Correctness and the Loop Invariant:


Time complexity = O(n^2), since there is a nested while loop inside a for loop, both based on input array variable A

Space complexity = O(n), since the method is based off input array A, with a lenght of n. No other array is created.
